        			<p ng-mouseover="addClass()"    ng-mouseleave="removeClass()">It is considered a rather obscure region, because although wines have been made in Molise as far back as 500 BC with influences coming from the Samnites, Etruscans and Romans, it only gained its independence as a wine region in the last half of the 20th century.

        			<h3>Campania</h3>
        			<p>Grapes have been grown in the fertile soil of Campania since ancient times, and one of the pleasures of traveling through this region in southern Italy is the chance to discover the unique varieties of wine produced in this area. From the rolling hillsides in the provinces of Benevento and Avellino to the steeply terraced vineyards of the Amalfi Coast and the islands of Capri and Ischia to the slopes of Mt. Vesuvius, the wines of Campania are as varied as the landscape. Enjoy locally made wines during your holiday, especially since they pair wonderfully with the regional foods of Campania.

               	<p ng-mouseover="addClass()"    ng-mouseleave="removeClass()">Basilicata has everything it needs to produce fine, ageworthy red wines and yet the region is rarely on the radar of wine lovers, much less serious collectors. A little while ago, just around the turn of the new century, some knockout Aglianico del Vulture wines promised better things to come, but that momentum was not sustained and the area fell on tough times, with numerous estates, restaurants and hotels closing shop. But after languishing in the doldrums for a spell, Basilicataâ€™s wine scene has perked up considerably, thanks to an energetic new generation of winemakers taking over their family domaines and a number of exciting new wineries now appearing on the scene.

                        Aglianico is a black grape grown in the southern regions of Italy, mostly Basilicata and Campania. The vine originated in Greece and was brought to the south of Italy by Greek settlers. The name may be a corruption of vitis hellenica, Latin for "Greek vine."

               	<h3>Puglia</h3>
               	<p>If you want fruit-forward, ripe, red wine for a good price, look no further than Puglia. Some of the best values in Italian wine come from this sunny, dry region. Most Puglia wine is red, full-bodied and will pair well with a wide variety of foods. Producers in Puglia have focused on making great red wines and local grapes like Negroamaro, Primitivo, and Bombino Nero make for delicious drinking.

                        Primitivo is a dark-skinned grape known for producing inky, tannic wines, particularly Primitivo di Manduria and its naturally sweet Dolce Naturale variant. A classic Primitivo wine is high in both alcohol and tannins, intensely flavored and deeply colored.

               	<h3>Calabria</h3>
               	<p>Calabrian wine (Italian: Vino Calabrese) is Italian wine from the Calabria region of southern Italy. Over 90% of the region's wine production is red wine, with a large portion made from the Gaglioppo grape. Calabria has 12 Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) regions but only 4% of the yearly production is classified as DOC wine.<br>
